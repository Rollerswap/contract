What is a RollerSwap? is a next-generation decentralized exchange and secure wallet platform designed to meet the needs of modern
 crypto traders and investors, and that it is a PEB-20 token built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network.
Our mission is to empower our users with the tools they need to manage their digital assets safely, 
efficiently, and intuitively. At the core of our platform is a fast and reliable swapping engine that 
allows users to trade a variety of cryptocurrencies with ease, while our secure wallet ensures the safety and integrity of their funds.

But RollerSwap is more than just a swapping platform and a wallet. Our vision extends to the future, where we plan to integrate advanced 
technologies like AI to further enhance the functionality and usability of our platform.
In addition, RollerSwap has already launched an AI chatbot named Rolla on its website, which is currently in development and will provide 
users with personalized assistance and market insights in the near future.
We also believe in the importance of community, and our goal is to build a vibrant ecosystem around RollerSwap that brings together 
like-minded individuals and projects to share knowledge, ideas, and opportunities.

RollerSwap has a maximum supply of 50 million ROLS tokens. Upon launch, 10 million tokens were immediately sent to a dead wallet, 
effectively reducing the total supply to 40 million tokens.
An additional 5 million tokens will be burnt during stage 2, and another 5 million tokens will be burnt in the future, bringing 
the total circulating supply to 30 million tokens and making the circulating supply 100% of the total supply.

Regarding tokenomics, there is a 2% fee applied to both buying and selling ROLS tokens. Of this fee, 1% goes towards supporting 
the development team and ongoing project development. The remaining 1% is added to the liquidity pool, increasing the overall 
liquidity and stability of the platform.
